# 🧙‍♂️ The C# Player's Guide — Exercise Solutions

Welcome to my repository of solutions for the programming challenges found in **The C# Player's Guide (5th Edition)** by R. B. Whitaker.

This repository serves both as a personal learning journey and a public resource for other learners interested in mastering C# through this excellent book.

## 📘 About the Book

*The C# Player's Guide* is one of the most popular beginner-to-intermediate C# books. It covers essential concepts in a hands-on and engaging way, culminating in a series of practical coding challenges.

You can find the official book here: [https://csharpplayersguide.com](https://csharpplayersguide.com)

## 🛠️ Structure

Each folder corresponds to one of the **"Book Levels"**.

Example:

level-03/\
└── HelloWorldApp\
└── WhatComesNextApp\
level-04/\
...


Whenever needed, I've included a `README.md` or comments within the code to explain design choices or highlight important C# concepts.
