# ðŸŒŸ Challenge: Consolas and Telim

In this exercise, you create a small **interactive console program** that takes user input and produces a response.  
The goal is to simulate Telimâ€™s bread distribution process, where the program records who receives the bread.

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Requirements

- Display a starting message: `"Bread is ready."`  
- Ask the user: `"Who is the bread for?"`  
- Read the userâ€™s input (the name).  
- Display a confirmation message: `"Noted: <name> got bread."`

- Displaying output using `Console.WriteLine()`
